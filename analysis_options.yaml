# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# Issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# Activate a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps, packages, and plugins
# designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

linter:
  # Customize the lint rules applied to this project in the section below.
  # You can disable rules from the included `flutter_lints` package or enable
  # additional rules. A list of available lints and their documentation is at
  # https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project, you can also
  # suppress it for a single line or a specific file using the `// ignore: name_of_lint`
  # and `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    # prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule
